# High-Tech Hydration Vest Project

## Overview
The **High-Tech Hydration Vest** is a user-centered design project aimed at enhancing hydration management for runners. This project was developed through a comprehensive UX process, including user interviews, persona creation, journey mapping, ideation, and prototyping. The vest is designed to collect hydration data, monitor marathon performance metrics, and provide alerts when it's time to drink water.

## UX Process

### 1. User Interviews
We conducted interviews with several runners to understand their hydration habits, challenges, and experiences during races. Key insights included:
- Many runners struggle with maintaining adequate hydration levels before and during races.
- Participants expressed frustration with traditional hydration methods, such as drinking from cups provided at water stations.
- There is a strong desire for a solution that offers real-time feedback on hydration needs.

### 2. User Persona
Based on the interviews, we created a user persona named **Pierre**, a dedicated runner preparing for his first marathon. Pierre's characteristics include:
- **Age**: 28
- **Running Frequency**: 3-4 times a week
- **Goals**: Complete the marathon while maintaining optimal hydration.
- **Pain Points**: Forgetting to hydrate during runs and struggling with hydration logistics.

### 3. User Journey Mapping
We mapped Pierre's journey from preparation to post-race reflection, identifying key touchpoints where the hydration vest could enhance his experience:
- **Preparation**: Setting hydration goals and adjusting vest settings.
- **During the Race**: Receiving alerts to hydrate based on real-time data.
- **Post-Race**: Reviewing hydration data to improve future performance.

### 4. Ideation
In brainstorming sessions, we generated ideas for features that would address Pierre's needs:
- Continuous hydration monitoring.
- Real-time alerts when it's time to drink water.
- Integration with performance metrics (pace, distance).
- A user-friendly interface that displays hydration levels clearly.

### 5. Prototyping
We developed a prototype of the High-Tech Hydration Vest that includes:
- **Hydration Tracking**: Monitors fluid intake and dehydration levels.
- **Performance Metrics**: Collects data on pace and distance.
- **Alerts**: Provides notifications when it's time to hydrate based on personalized goals.
